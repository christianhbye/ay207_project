Repository with an interactive notebook to visualize EM waves propagating in lossy materials (plasmas). The code utilizes a FDTD simulation written by me and Prof. Aaron Parsons (UC Berkeley), largely based on the book Understanding the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method, John B. Schneider, www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/ufdtd, 2010.
